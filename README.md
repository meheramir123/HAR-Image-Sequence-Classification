# HAR-Image-Sequence-Classification

This repository implements Human Action Recognition (HAR) using sequences of images.  
It uses a TimeDistributed CNN + LSTM model with grayscale or RGB frames.

## Features
- Sequence-based frame input
- Multi-layer CNN for spatial feature extraction
- LSTM for temporal modeling
- Training/Validation accuracy and loss plots
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- Test predictions aggregated per video
